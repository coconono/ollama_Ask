# Ollama Ask

A simple python script to talk to an Ollama install on your machine.

I had an idea for a trivial task so I put copilot on it. Then I fiddled with it some more.

Perhaps I dream of making this a local instance of warp.dev? Do I dream?

right now I have it hard coded to run a specific ministral model. 

I will probably work on this more when I have free time. Or you can help?
